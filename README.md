# Networking
## The Benefits and Constraints of Network Types and Standards
### The Different Types of Networks
There are different ways that computers can be connected over a network, this is called the type of network, the systems that require information are called clients and the systems that provide information are called servers and the type of network dictates how these systems communicate with each other.
#### Peer to peer
##### Purpose
The first type of network is called a peer to peer network, this network has no single system that provides the role of the server, instead each computer on the network stores files and acts as the server. This means that each computer has equal responsibility for providng data. The purpose of a peer to peer to network is to allow computers to transfer files between eachother without the need of a server to control the data flow.
##### Benefits
* Easy to set up and configure new systems
* All resources and contents are shared by all the computers on the network
* Very reliable, as there is no dependency on a certain system to work, meaning that if one system goes down the network can still continue to function.
* The overall cost to set up and maintain the network is considerably less that other network types
##### Constraints
* The whole system is decentralized, therefore it is difficult to administer, meaning that one person cannot determine the whole accessibility of the whole network
* Less security, meaning that viruses, spywares, tojans, etc can easily be transmitted throughout the network, infecting all the peers on the network
* Data recovery or backup is difficult as each system controls its own data, meaning each computer on the network will need its own backup
##### Resource Implications
Compared to other network types a peer to peer network does not require many resources, they only need at least 2 computers with an internet connection.
##### Commercial Oppurtinity
As peer to peer networks are relitively cheap to set up, this could be a useful type of network for small busineses with a small amount of systems to manage. 
##### Information Sharing
Information on the network is transferred through the each peer system on the network and requires no server to manage the data transmission.
##### Collaboration
As peer to peer networks are used for file sharing, you cannot use a peer to peer network to collaborate on the same documents or work together on the same projects. However the use of file sharing helps project groups share work between eachother and share the same software allowing all users on the network to have the same resources.
#### Client-Server
##### Purpose
The client-server model is the relationship between computers in which one computer acts as the server, in which the other computers makes service requests to. The clients are dependent on the server to provide and manage information. The purpose of this network is to hold all data of the network in one centralized location and to deal with multiple clients at once.
##### Benefits
* It is easy to manage, this is because all files are stored at the same place allowing files to be easily found.
* It is easier to backup and recover files, this is because, all the data is stored on the server which makes it easy to make a back up of it. Also in the case of a break down if data is lost, it can be recovered effeciently.
* Upgrades to the network can be easily made, as you would only have to make changes to the server.
* The security of the network has the possibility of being high, as you only have to have security for the server
##### Constraints
* Too many requests from clients could lead to congestion, which would dramatically slow down the network and could lead to the break down of the server.
* This type of network is also very dependent on the server, meaning if the server fails then the whole network will fail
* It is very expensive to install and manage the server on the network
* You will need professionals to maintain the servers and other technical details of the network.
##### Commercial Oppurtinity
These types of networks are usually used for web browsers as they use multiple servers to hold the ip addresses of websites so that they can provide clients with the right ip address.

#### Cloud
##### Purpose
A cloud network allows a user to access data and programs over the internet instead of using the computers hard drive. The purpose of this network is to allow multiple users to access the same software and data, and therefore work together on the same documents and allow the storage of data that all users can access.
##### Benefits
* Using a cloud network saves money, as you don't need to invest money in storage hardware as all data and software is stored in the cloud
* A cloud network is also more reliable than
