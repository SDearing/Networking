# Networking
## The Benefits and Constraints of Network Types and Standards
### The Different Types of Networks
#### Peer to peer
There are different ways that computers can be connected over a network, this is called the type of network, the systems that require information are called clients and the systems that provide information are called servers and the type of network dictates how these systems communicate with each other. The first type of network is called a peer to peer network, this network has no single system that provides the role of the server, instead each computer on the network stores files and acts as the server. This means that each computer has equal responsibility for providng data. A benifet of this type of network is it is efficient when sharing large files on the network, as each system can have the file stored on the computer and then send different sections of the file, meaning the workload of sending the file is shared, instead of one system handling the whole file. Another benefit is that the peer to peer network is very simple to set up and configuring new systems on the network is very simple to do as it requires. However a constraint of a peer to peer network is that data recovery is more difficult to manage as each computer handles its own data storage, meaning that each computer needs to have its own backup.
